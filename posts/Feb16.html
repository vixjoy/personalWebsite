<p>This past Saturday, I went to B-Sides in Tampa Florida.
   The convention was held in a very nice court room.
    And a nice lady gave me a doughnut when I entered the door.</p>
<p>My favorite presentation at B-Sides was on the art of breaking and entering.
   Jonathan Echavarria and David Switzer (<b>@Und3rF10w</b> and <b>@violentlydave</b> on Twitter) gave the presentation.
   The best part of the talk was the location, we were in a court room.
   The presentation was detailed and technical.
   With a 35-dollar tool, a RTL-SDR (Software Defined Radio).
</p>The RTL-SDR picks up many different radio broadcasted radio signals.
 The RTL-SDR is used practically for broadcast television in Europe.
  The signals you can pick up with this tool include aviation traffic, freight trains, marine traffic.
<p>I could sit in my car down the street and see all the power consumption of every house in a 60-yard range.
   How is this possible?
</p>The power consumption data is being transmitted so that the people who come by to read your meter never need to leave their car.
 For the electric company employees this makes a lot of sense.
 What if its raining cats and dogs? What if there is a literal dog?
 I would not want an electric company worker to risk their safety by entering a private property.
<p>How can we use this unencrypted data? When you’re at work, your lights should be off.
   When you’re out of town, your everything should be off.
   With an automated monitoring tool, we could know with a high degree of certainty, the target’s entire schedule.
   If there is a lull in power consumption every weekday from 9 until 5, then that must be the target’s work schedule.
    If there is a lull in power for 3 days straight, I am can be pretty sure the target is out of town.
