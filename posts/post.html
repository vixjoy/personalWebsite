              <p>I spent much of my time this week behind a book rather than a monitor.
                 Chapter one of Hacking the Art of Exploitation is, in my humble opinion, the perfect explanation of hacking.
                  The second chapter is a technical and in-depth review of C programming and low-level processes. </p>
              <p><b>"Most people associate hacking with breaking the law and assume that everyone who engages in hacking actives is a criminal"</b> <i>(Erickson p1).</i>
                 In my mind hacking is not about the law, hacking is an attitude.
                 Hacking is trying to figure out a clever solution to a complex problem, often via trial and error.
                  The solutions that come out of this method can be used for good or bad. </p>
              <p>In chapter two, I found value in the section regarding the x86 processor.
                 The x86 processor is used by all Windows machines and many of the new Macintosh computers.
                  The x86 chip was developed and manufactured by Intel which has created what has been considered, up until recently, one of the most widely used and reputable chips on the market.</p>
              <p>The recent hardware vulnerability, "Meltdown", could change their standings among the computer science community.
                Meltdown is a hardware vulnerability that allows rouge processes to read all memory without proper authorization.
                Similarly "Specter" is another recently exposed vulnerability.
                Specter breaks down the isolation between different running applications, meaning a malicious application can see sensitive data in another application.
                Major company's like Apple and Windows released emergency patches to cover the security breaches.
                The effects of Meltdown are broad. It is unlikely that you were unaffected.
                The vulnerability in Intel's chip was found by Google and reported to them approximately six months ago.
                Meltdown was kept under wraps for a while. Intel created a software workaround for the hardware vulnerability.
                Their little "software bandaid" reduced the power of the chip possibly by 30%!</p>

                <span class="caption text-muted">Meltdown and Specter</span>


                <p> I doubt society at large will notice the hit in computational power following the implementation of the software workaround.
                 Most computer users are not CPU bound, but I/O bound.
                 A non-developer probably spends most of their time using web based applications.
                  The internet connection is going to be the limiting factor in this case, not the CPU power.
                Remember that when you're helping your Grandma buy her next computer.
                It's OK to splurge a bit on faster internet speeds to pair with a weaker CPU.
                 I took up a bit of an interest in x86 because I believed in the longevity of Intels chips.
                  After a vulnerability such as this, doubt sets in.</p>

                        <p>For next weeks blog post, I will do do a review of Pico CTF. I will go through some of the level-one challenges and explain the ones I liked or the ones that stumped me. If you have a specific request for a challenge you would like me to attempt, let me know via the contact me tab.</p>
