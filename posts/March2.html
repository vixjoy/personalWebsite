  <p>Joe is a Senior project engineer at AT&T. He graduated from college with an Associates degree and has been in the industry for over 25 years.
When asked about the company culture at AT&T, Joe provided “[AT&T is a] very large company, very old company. Things are not moving at break neck speed. Lots of people have been there for 25+ years. The culture is nice but sometimes sort of slow for me.”</p>
    <p>“Junior developers will enter the company fresh out of college but have never been in industry. They don’t understand the moving parts of the industry. They work nights, weekends and holidays for an arbitrary deadline”. Joe explains that when his supervisor gives him an unrealistic deadline he can simply request more time to complete a project. This contrasts with the feelings of pressure often felt by junior developers.</p>
      <p>Joe worked for 16 years at McClatchy. The culture there was different. McClatchy focused on innovation collaboration and good ideas. The culture there is not a rush but its more about innovating and wanting to push things forward.
"AT&T is so big and set in its ways, turning the ship takes a really long time. We can adjust one thing at a time.”</p>
        <p>When asked about the company culture he would implement in his own hypothetical startup Joe said, “Agile. Any new start-up company would need to conform to Agile. Listen to what the customers want. Really need to listen and provide value in a timely manner. If you can’t do it somebody else can."</p>
          <p>Red flags include but are not limited to “respect. Employees are people not objects. Don’t mistreat your employees. Being unable to get back to you quickly during the interview process is a bad sign too.”
</p>
            <p>Joe’s work scheduler is pretty flexible. He works eight hour days and can work from home one day a week. Joe enjoys two or three one-week vacations and about 10 long weekends annually.

          <h2>Some last-minute advice from Joe:</h2>
        <p><li>When first starting out you may be on pager duty, find out how frequent it is and how bad it is.</li>
      <li>If you take a contract position you need to make sure you know when you’re going to convert. Establish a timeline early in the process. Contract positions are bad for free time and vacation.</li>

        <li>Try all the aspects of the field you’re going into. Find the one you enjoy and are good at, be the best at the one thing you can do that no one else can.
</li>
          <li>Keep criticism constructive and don’t bash other people’s stuff.</li>
            <li>Don’t be cocky.</li>
