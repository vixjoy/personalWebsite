                <p>You may have clicked on this post believing it would be focused on the hackathon. You were wrong. Instead, I will focus on Equifax. For those of you that are not familiar with the name Equifax, let me provide you with a few quick links:
</p>

            <li><a href ="https://consumerist.com/tag/equi-facts/">The Consumer List</a></li>

            </p>



            <p>When I found out this hackathon was sponsored by Equifax I was happy because nobody respects cyber security more than those adversely affected by a lack of it. I was wrong. Big ships turn very slowly. Equifax continues to make irresponsible choices when it comes to users and their data.
</p>
            <p>Equifax kindly provided each team with an AWS account. We were granted access to this account in order to implement more powerful and dynamic solutions. Someone created a username and password for every school to use. Our username was 'secuser2'. Our password was originally.. also.. 'secuser2'. A tech wizard with Equifax decided that wasn’t secure enough. They changed all of the passwords. Our password was 'Florida1234'. This is more secure, because there is absolutely no way we could guess any of the other schools’ password.
 </p>

            <p>A malicious user somehow gained access to our account despite Equifax’s best effort to keep our data safe. This malicious user deleted our work and spawned 40 powerful virtual machines. These virtual machines were quickly put to work mining cryptocurrencies. Because we all read the AWS terms of use, we were outraged. We knew this was a violation of AWS terms of use. As soon as we were able, we quickly disbanded the virtual machines and put a stop to the abuse of AWS. Work continued. But the damage had already been done. 10 hours before we were supposed to present our project, AWS locked our account and stopped us from modifying our project, thus crippling our presentation.
</p>

                 <p> Equifax also gave us a prompt. The prompt was in a word: vague. To sum it up, the prompt asked us to create a policy that fixed all security ever. One could say this prompt was somewhere between a hackathon and a PHD dissertation.
</p>
<p>I am deeply dissatisfied with the judging done by our friends at Equifax. We presented to exactly 2 judges in an empty room. We were not allowed to watch competing teams’ presentations. If you’re not familiar with the structure of a typical hackathon, usually the exchange of ideas is emphasized. Our team was not among the winners and our loss is hard to accept because we implemented the best solution that we could think of.  I am literally unable to think of a solution better than the one we gave and I would love to have seen the ideas that were superior. Our team arrived with a set of knowledge and we left with a very similar set of knowledge. While we learned from each other, we were not able to learn anything from the many other teams who participated in this event. That, to me, is a disappointment. Equifax seems to care about security but doesn’t seem to understand what’s required to improve it.
